      <title>“v” or “nu”? A typesetting detail one should pay attention to</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Take a look at the image below. What are the highlighted letters in each equation respectively?</p><p align="center"><img src="/images/eq12.svg" height="70px" alt="Times New Roman &amp; Symbol" title="Times New Roman &amp; Symbol" oncontextmenu="return false;" class="nofancybox"></p><p>It’s easy to recognize the letter in Eq.① is $v$ (the Latin letter v) representing velocity and that in Eq.② is $\nu$ (the Greek alphabet nu) representing frequency, since both equations are classic in physics. In certain contexts, the recognition is easy. However, if we take away the contexts, could it be possible for one to know whether a glyph is v or nu? Or, if these glyphs appear in a shared context? Confusion may emerge.</p><span id="more"></span><p>This confusion is caused by the fonts “Times New Roman” (TNR) and “Symbol”. Both equations are typed in MathType with TNR for Latin alphabets and Symbol for Greek ones. As you can notice, the v and nu look quite similar.</p><p>Let’s see how other fonts deal with these two alphabets<sup><a href="#font">A</a></sup>: </p><p align="center"><img src="/images/vnufonts.svg" width="380px" oncontextmenu="return false;" class="nofancybox"></p><p>It’s obvious that all fonts in the table other than TNR and Symbol design the glyphs of the two in a clearer way to avoid confusion. In these fonts, v is smoother, while nu is sharper with a point at the bottom, thus the distinction being significant. To correctly handle these two alphabets in your document, a normal and universal method should be adopted. As far as I have seen, some document creators even use “upsilon” (υ) to replace v so as to distinguish v from nu, which is totally wrong.</p><p>Here I offer two suggestions on appropriate ways to address this issue. </p><ul><li>First and most recommended, use a DTP tool more suitable for typesetting scientific content, such as TeX and Founder Bookmaker, rather than MS Word.</li><li>Second, if the template you use requires you to use TNR as the main font, try to use another font for “v” in math environments. To my knowledge, <hm>Palatino Linotype</hm> or <hm>Book Antiqua</hm> are widely used in nationwide unified exams and high school physics textbooks<sup><a href="#pep">[1]</a></sup>. See the image below for the comparison after the font alternation.</li></ul><p align="center"><img src="/images/eq1234.svg" height="70px" alt="Before &amp; after font alternation" title="Before &amp; after font alternation" oncontextmenu="return false;" class="nofancybox"></p><p>So next time, when typesetting a scientific document that includes v and nu simultaneously, consider the aforementioned advice, for more standardized typesetting that complies with scientific publishing normalities, and not confusing your peer reviewers if you submit a paper, or your students if you make an exam paper.</p><p><strong>Note</strong><br><span id="font"></span></p><ol type="A"><li>Computer Modern is the default font of TeX. Founder BZ NPS &amp; S10 are default fonts of Founder BookMaker.</li></ol><p><strong>Related Links</strong></p><ol><li><span id="pep"><a href="https://basic.smartedu.cn/tchMaterial/detail?contentType=assets_document&amp;contentId=708256b6-6f06-4d14-89c7-4df16dfe3b81&amp;catalogType=tchMaterial&amp;subCatalog=tchMaterial&amp;ticket=MWJlYTMwYzEtNzliYy00OWQxLWJhZmYtMTljYjE4ZmY1ZDE3">人民教育出版社课程教材研究所物理课程教材研究开发中心. 普通高中教科书物理必修第一册. 北京: 人民教育出版社, 2019: 21</a></span></li></ol>]]></content>
